## Cashierless-Counter
For example - Suppose where one time takes one minute to be scanned, so if a person with monthly shopping interest has 50 items then it will take 50 minutes. Along with that we have  a long queue which consists of 4-5 persons. With our model you can reduce that 50 minutes to 1 minute.  Time complexity is O(1) instead of O(n). Also we have introduced a new method of payment via crypto currencyÂ Solana.
